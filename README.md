## the app's purpose
the app is meant to be a student managing application, but also a type of social media for students. kids can see their grades, post school-related things, manage events in the public/common calendar, and just have a great time all-around

# DISCLAIMER!!!!! 
this code has been made with AI-assisted coding, regular questions, not vibe-coding! the AI was a little helper, not the whole captain. the model used was devstral 2 small, hosted on my personal PC. this being my first project, i might have asked some really stupid questions... i am a noob! don't make fun of me please.


hope everyone loves the app!
